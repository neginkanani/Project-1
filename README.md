#Overview of Project

Acute economic volatility, catalyzed by the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has caused significant financial turmoil in the US. The goal of this analysis will be to isolate and evaluate these economic challenges in relation to the U.S. housing sector. Specifically, our analysis seeks to evaluate the influence and/or impact of rent control measures. 

This project represents a cursory analysis of rent control policy within the U.S. It will leverage data sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Zillow, and other sources to analyze various metrics relating to this policy tool. This includes stock market data, income and rental rates data, CPI data (as a proxy for inflation, geared specifically at consumers), and data reporting rates of homelessness.

Prior to evaluating these specific metrics, we use population data to match cities based on their population and demographic composition. This step is necessary as it will effectively build a counterfactual, which will allow us to more meaningfully analyze the relationship between rent control policy and our selected variables within the scope of this project.
